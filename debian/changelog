colord (0.1.21-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/one_shot_colord-sane:
    - Rework colord-sane to be run once per sane probe. This works around
      bugs in libsane and its plugins, which otherwise leak fds causing all
      manner of bad behaviour, such as high CPU usage. (Closes: 668325)
  * debian/patches/initialise_gdbus_connection_sooner.patch:
    - Initialise connection variable from the bus_connected callback rather
      than the name_acquired callback. Fixes a race where colord could try to
      process a request before name_acquired was called, resulting in an
      abort().

colord (0.1.21-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    - Add libdbus-1-dev to build depends; the patches in 0.1.21-2 introduce a
      new dbus dependency, causing FTBFS on !linux archs (Closes: 689300).
      Thanks, Pino Toscano!

colord (0.1.21-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/also_sanitise_username_for_dbus.patch:
    - Sanitise username when used as a component of a DBus object path.
      Fixes crash in cd_device_register_object (Closes: 675852) (LP: #1021374)
  * debian/patches/fix_colord-sane_dbus_threading.patch:
    - Initialise libdbus threadsafety in colord-sane. (Probably) fixes multiple
      crashes from colord-sane in libdbus (LP: #844286). Plausibly fixes other
      bad colord-sane behaviour, such as 100% CPU usage (Closes: 668325)
  * debian/rules:
  * debian/control:
    - Add dh_autoreconf to pick up the build system changes from
      fix_colord-sane_dbus_threading.patch and add all the various
      build-depends required.

colord (0.1.18-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
  * debian/colord.postrm:
    - Fix purge action when colord failed to install correctly. (Closes: 660666)
  * debian/control:
    - Drop unnecessary build-depends libusb2-dev [kfreebsd].  Thanks,
      Robert Millan! (Closes: 659624)

  * debian/source/local-options:
  * debian/patches/series:

      from upstream cleaner: the patch lands in debian-patches, and disappears
      when we grab the upstream version containing the cherry-pick.
  * debian/patches/01_fix_colord_sane.diff, pre-cherry-picked from upstream.
    - Fixes issues with DBus spawning colord-sane, and with colord-sane
      communicating with colord when run as the colord user

colord (0.1.16-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/colord.postinst:

      colord user actually exists.  (Closes: 658353)
  * debian/colord.install:

  * New upstream release

    - Remove /var/lib/colord on purge; package is now puiparts clean.

    - Create /var/lib/colord if necessary; we can not rely on adduser creating
      this directory if the user has previously purged colord.
    - Quieten needless output from adduser.

colord (0.1.15-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules:
    + Pass --disable-examples to configure; we don't ship them, and they add

      kFreeBSD build. (Closes: 652427)

 -- Christopher James Halse Rogers <raof@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 22 Dec 2011 10:15:18 +1100

colord (0.1.15-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    + Fixes sqlite injection vulnerability, preventing malicious applications
      from corrupting colord's database (Closes: #650021).
  * debian/patches/01_use_polkit_owner_annotation.patch:
    + Cherry-pick from upstream, enabling use of the PolicyKit "owner"
      annotation.

      PolicyKit to understand the "owner" annotation at runtime.
  * debian/rules:
    + Re-enable PolicyKit support now that the "owner" annotation is supported.
  * debian/patches/06_use_dbus_security_for_permissions.diff:

colord (0.1.13-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Christopher James Halse Rogers ]
  * New upstream release. (Closes: #643724)
  * Update libcolord1 symbols for new upstream.
  * debian/colord.postinst:
  * debian/rules:
    + Run colord daemon as a system user, rather than root.  It only needs
      write access to /var/lib/colord and access to scanner devices, which
      is handled by udev.
  * debian/rules:
  * debian/patches/07_fix_disable_polkit_build.diff:
  * debian/patches/06_use_dbus_security_for_permissions.diff:
    + Use DBus' at_console context to regulate access to the colord daemon.
      PolicyKit doesn't allow non-root processes to query whether a different
      a user is authorised to perform an action.  DBus' at_console context
      duplicates the existing PolicyKit policy.
  * debian/control:
    + Fix typo in package description.  (Closes: #640525)
  * debian/control:
    + Add missing liblcms2-dev, libdbus-1-dev, libglib2.0-dev dependencies to
      libcolord-dev, to fix FTBFS of reverse dependencies.

  [ Sjoerd Simons ]
  * New upstream release (0.1.13) (Closes: #643724)
  * debian/patches/07_fix_disable_polkit_build.diff:
    + Removed, fixed upstream
  * debian/libcolord1.symbols: Update symbols for 0.1.13
