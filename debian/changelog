colord (0.1.12-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Update libcolord1 symbols for new upstream.
  * debian/colord.postinst:
  * debian/rules:
    + Run colord daemon as a system user, rather than root.  It only needs
      write access to /var/lib/colord and access to scanner devices, which
      is handled by udev.
  * debian/rules:
  * debian/patches/07_fix_disable_polkit_build.diff:
  * debian/patches/06_use_dbus_security_for_permissions.diff:
    + Use DBus' at_console context to regulate access to the colord daemon.
      PolicyKit doesn't allow non-root processes to query whether a different
      a user is authorised to perform an action.  DBus' at_console context
      duplicates the existing PolicyKit policy.
